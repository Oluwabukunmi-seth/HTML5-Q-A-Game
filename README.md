## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have a web server set up (e.g., Apache, Nginx) or use a local development server (e.g., Node.js) to serve the project files.
3. Configure the server to handle XML files (if using server-side scripting).
4. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Configuration

You can customize the game's behavior by modifying the `config.json` file. This file allows you to configure options such as text display, image assets, and button colors.

## Adding Questions

To add or edit questions, open the `xml/questions.xml` file and follow the XML structure. Each `<question>` element should contain a `<questionText>`, multiple `<answer>` elements, and a `<correctAnswer>`.

## Localization

The game supports multiple languages. You can create localization files (e.g., `localization_en.xml`, `localization_zh.xml`) in the `xml/` directory to provide translations for the game's text.

## Server-Side Script (Optional)

If you are using server-side scripting, ensure that your server-side script (e.g., `xml_handling.php` or Node.js script) can handle data requests and serve XML data to your JavaScript files. Modify the script to suit your server environment.

## JavaScript Files (game.js, utilities.js)

These files contain the logic for your game and editor. Ensure they have the necessary code to load XML data, manage questions, and handle user interactions.
